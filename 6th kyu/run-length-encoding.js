// Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

// Task
// Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

// Examples
// As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

// runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
//  //=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]
// It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:

// runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
//  // => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]


//PREP

//Parameters - a string

//return - an array, each value of which is a length 2 array



var runLengthEncoding = function(str){
    arr = str.split('')
    result = []
    // lastchar = `${str[0]}`
    count = 1
    for (i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) {
            count++
            if (i == arr.length - 1) {
                result.push([count, `${arr[i]}`])
            }
            continue
        }
        else {
            result.push([count, `${arr[i - 1]}`])
            count = 1
            if (i == arr.length - 1) {
                result.push([count, `${arr[i]}`])
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(result)
    return(result)
  }


runLengthEncoding('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb')
